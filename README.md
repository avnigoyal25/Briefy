Briefy is a project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to automatically summarize PDF documents. It aims to simplify the process of extracting key information from lengthy PDFs, making it easier for users to quickly grasp the main points without having to read the entire document.
It uses the concept of extractive summarization, a technique used to generate summaries by selecting and combining important sentences or phrases directly from the source text.
